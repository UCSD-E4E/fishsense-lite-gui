# Fishsense-Lite-GUI
This is a desktop app developed with C# and the Avalonia Framework, following MVVM Architecture. Users can calibrate images, and annotate head, tail, and body data from the fish. The data will be stored into a SQLite Database local to the directory that contains the images.

Below is a task list for the app:
- [x] Display Images
- [x] Sync Data with SQLite Database and ensure users can save previous annotations.
- [x] Add vectorized annotations.
- [x] Cycle through images and change color of bounding boxes with built in hotkeys to allow quick labeling of the data.
- [ ] Remove previous annotations.
- [ ] Select first image from Scrollviewer.
- (Future features will be updated as they are determined.)
